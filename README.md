# Advent of code 2025

This is my repository for the Advent of Code 2024. I will be solving the puzzles in [Dosato](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato).
<br>

## Context

Dosato is a programming language that I created. It is a unique and robust intepreted language designed for the general purpose. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use. This is one of the main reasons why I chose to use Dosato for solving the Advent of Code puzzles.

### Why Dosato?

I like it :P, it's really not a bad language for this and I barely get any extra challenges from the language itself. It is also just cool to solve these puzzles in a language that I created myself.

## How to run the code

To run the code, you will need to have the Dosato interpreter installed on your machine. You can download the Dosato interpreter [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato/releases/latest). Once you have the Dosato interpreter installed, you can run the code by typing the following command in the terminal:

```
dosato <filename>
```

Where `<filename>` is the name of the Dosato file that you want to run. For example, if you want to run the code in the file `day1.to`, you would type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dosato day1.to
```

Thats it really. I hope you enjoy the solutions. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am always happy to help.


## Log

### Day 1
- Part 1
    - Ended up doing the mathy approach
- Part 2
    - Mathy approach was not the easier way here, spending more time than I wanted to on this one, but switched to a more straightforward approach and got it done. Optimised to use a mathy approach after the fact.
### Day 2
- Part 1
    - Straightforward implementation, but a bit slow.
- Part 2
    - This slowness carried over to part 2 as well. Need to optimise this heavily, there must be some trick to detect repeated digits without checking the ENTIRE range. (update later: I made it way quicker with modulos)
### Day 3
- Part 1
    - Very easy implementation.
- Part 2
    - Had to remake the entire thing to accomodate for the new logic, but it was still pretty straightforward, works with any battery size.
